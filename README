# 🔬 Methodology
Data Processing Pipeline

1. Data Cleaning & Integration
- Timestamp normalization with day-first format handling
- BTC trade filtering and symbol standardization
- Numeric data cleansing (currency symbols, commas)
- Sentiment label mapping (Fear=0, Greed=1)

2. Feature Engineering
- Daily aggregation of trading metrics
- Win rate calculation per day
- Buy/sell ratio computation
- Volatility proxies (price std, PnL std)
- Lagged sentiment variables

4. Statistical Analysis
- Correlation analysis
- T-tests for group differences
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
- Granger causality tests
- Logistic regression modeling

5. Advanced Analytics
- Trader segmentation via K-means clustering
- Event studies around sentiment switches
- Predictive modeling of PnL direction

# 📊 Key Findings
- During FEAR periods, trading activity significantly INCREASES with better performance

# 📈 Correlation Analysis
- All trading metrics show negative correlation with sentiment (Greed=1, Fear=0):

Unique accounts: -0.433 (strongest)
Trade count: -0.282
Total volume: -0.260
Net realized PnL: -0.216

# 🤖 Predictive Model Performance
- Next-day PnL direction prediction: 79% accuracy
- Features: sentiment, volume, trade count, win rate
- Strong predictive power for market direction

# 📞 Conclusion
This analysis successfully demonstrates a significant contrarian relationship between market sentiment and trading behavior. The findings challenge conventional wisdom by showing that fear periods present superior trading opportunities with higher volumes, better returns, and more participant activity.
The 79% accurate predictive model and statistically significant results provide a robust foundation for developing sentiment-driven trading strategies that can generate alpha in cryptocurrency markets.
